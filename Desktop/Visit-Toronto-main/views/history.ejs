                Toronto was originally inhabited by Indigenous peoples before becoming a British settlement in 1793.

                Over time, it grew into Canada's largest city, known for its multiculturalism and economic strength.
                Approximately 12,500 years ago the Laurentide Ice Sheet, a continental glacier that covered northeastern North America, retreated from the area of present-day Toronto. Soon afterward small groups of Indigenous peoples moved into the area to hunt animals such as caribou. Around 5,000 years ago, settlements in hunting territories began to form, and people congregated in large spring or summer gatherings at the mouths of rivers to fish, trade and bury their dead. By 500 CE, the population of Southern Ontario had reached 10,000, and was made up mostly of Algonquian-speaking peoples.

                At some point between 7,000 and 2,000 years ago, Indigenous peoples discovered an overland shortcut between Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay. Later known as the “Toronto Passage,” this trail was an important north-south route for both Indigenous peoples and Europeans.
                By the mid-1830s, the colonial government had made treaties with Indigenous peoples for the surrender of their territories, covering most of the arable lands in Upper Canada. One of these treaties was the Toronto Purchase (also known as Treaty 13). First drawn up in 1787, a revision of the agreement was made in 1805 between local First Nations and colonial authorities. The Purchase covers much of present-day Toronto, from Lake Ontario to the city’s western and northern limits. Toronto’s eastern portion is covered by one of the Williams Treaties, signed in 1923. (See also Upper Canada Land Surrenders; Reserves in Ontario.)

            Toronto is the main urban cultural centre in English Canada. It is the home of the large University of Toronto (1827), Ryerson University (1948), the more recent York University (1959), the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Ontario College of Art And Design, the world-renowned Royal Ontario Museum, the innovative Ontario Science Centre, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the National Ballet of Canada. Other nationally eminent artistic, musical and library institutions are found here along with top Canadian centres of medical and scientific research, and the world-class Toronto Zoo. Toronto is English Canada's leading theatre town and its rich multicultural variety is reflected in the performing arts.
